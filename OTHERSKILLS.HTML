        <p >I thrive as both a skilled video editor and a passionate
            photographer/videographer. As a second-year Computer Science Engineering 
            student, I seamlessly blend technical prowess with creative finesse.</p>
          
           <p> My proficiency in video editing transcends conventional boundaries,
                evident in my ability to craft compelling narratives, dynamic visuals,
                and seamless transitions.</p>
                                <p> Additionally, my keen eye for photography and videography has allowed me 
                   to capture moments with a unique perspective, bringing a fresh and captivating 
                   dimension to my work. Constantly honing my craft, I effortlessly balance the demands 
                   of academia with my commitment to visual excellence, making me a versatile
                    and dedicated contributor to any project. </p>
